	<h1> <strong> Reflection </strong> </h1>
	<p> <strong> This project was really fun to do because it allowed us to analyze documents from that
	time period, so that you could understand how the people at the time thought and what their beleifs
	were. I also enjoyed it because I go to go into extreme detail about how the revolutions started
	and the main philosophical causes of the revolution. It was difficult to cite my sources properly, 
	however, as well as add the correct amount of vocab words. </strong> </p>
