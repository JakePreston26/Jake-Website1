	that talked about origin stories from different religions and related them to the Big Bang theory.
	I was tasked with comparing how the origin story of the Greek and Efik people relate to the modern
	scientific concesus, the Big Bang. </strong> </center> </p>

	<h1> <strong> Reflection </strong> </h1>
	<p> <strong> This project was fun to do because it allowed me to draw a lot of pictures and make a fun
	comic book. It was also very fun to learn about th eorigin stories of the Greek and Efik people, as well
	as learning about the big bang and why people think that, and the evidence pointing towards it.</strong> </p>
