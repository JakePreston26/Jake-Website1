	New York" photography piece. We were tasked with taking a picture of a "human of DVC" (one of our peers) in order to capture
	their personality. We also had to write a short story using there words that gave insight into who they are
	as a person. This project taught us how to capture the essence of the subject in each photo. Click the phto below

	<h1> <strong> Reflection </strong> </h1>
	<p> <strong> I really enjoyed interviewing my subject because I feel like I got to learn a lot about
	her as a person. I learned a lot about her experiences through the answers she gave to my questions. 
	I really enjoyed the interview process because I feel like interviewing came easy to me. Some advice
	I would give to anyone doing this project is: </strong> </p>
		<ul>
		<strong>
			<li> Make sure to personally get to know your subject </li>
			<li> Make sure the picture captures the essence of your subject </li>
			<li> Make sure that your story relates heavily to the emotion that your picture evokes </li>
		</strong>
